# E-commerce Consumer Behavior Analysis

# Project Overview
This project explores consumer behavior in an e-commerce setting using Python. 
The goal is to identify how factors like **research time**, **decision speed**, **purchase frequency**, and **brand loyalty** affect **customer satisfaction**.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, we derive actionable business insights that can help optimize customer experience strategies.

# Dataset
- Source: [Ecommerce Consumer Behavior Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salahuddinahmedshuvo/ecommerce-consumer-behavior-analysis-data)
- Size: 1000 records
- Features include:  
  `Age`, `Frequency_of_Purchase`, `Brand_Loyalty`, `Product_Rating`, `Time_Spent_on_Product_Research(hours)`, `Return_Rate`, `Customer_Satisfaction`, `Time_to_Decision`

# Tools Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development

# Key Insights
- Customers who spend **1â€“1.5 hours** on product research have the **highest satisfaction**.
- **Quick decision-makers (â‰¤7 hours)** report **higher satisfaction** compared to slow decision-makers.
- Customers purchasing **3â€“4 times** show the **highest loyalty and satisfaction** peaks.
- **Brand loyalty** is moderately consistent among frequent buyers but does not drastically increase after multiple purchases.

# Business Recommendations
- Highlight product reviews and comparisons to support confident, quick purchasing.
- Offer loyalty rewards after the third purchase to maximize retention.
- Provide summaries and buying guides to help reduce decision hesitation.
- Implement nudges for hesitant users (like "Most popular choice" or "Limited stock" banners).

# Future Work
- Apply clustering to segment customer types
- Predict customer satisfaction using regression models
